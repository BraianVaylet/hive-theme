# How to use

## Theme Installation Instructions

Follow these instructions in order to start using your new theme.

1. Click the file at the bottom of your screen to un-zip it.

2. Open a new tab and go to URL chrome://extensions.

3. At the top right, slide the switch that says Developer mode to turn on Developer Mode.

Don't worry, this is only a theme, not an extension, so it can't do anything to your browser. (feel free to inspect the contents of the extension or the source code of this website if you don't believe me)

4. At the top left, click the Load unpacked button. Find the newly unzipped folder that you downloaded and select it.
